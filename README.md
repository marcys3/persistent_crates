# persistent_crates

I made this script to make persistent crates for ALiVE Campaign, as default saving is unreliable.
It works by saving content to profilenamespace.

# How to use:

Place the ammo box, give it variable name (Important) and paste following code to the object init.
```
[this] execVM "flf_persistence\flf_init.sqf";
```
